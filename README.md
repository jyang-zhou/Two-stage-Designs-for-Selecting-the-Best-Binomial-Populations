# Two-stage-Designs-for-Selecting-the-Best-Binomial-Populations
The research is to study two-stage designs in phase II clinical trials to select a better treatment among two experimental treatments in medical  eld. Usually people use Approximate Normal Distribution to test which one is better. However, Normal Distribution is time-consumed and can be only applied when sample size is large. If FDA want to test two drugs, this method is not e ecient. Therefore, this paper proposes methods to shorten the test process as well as the sample sizes by using Exact Binomial Distribution, Simon's two-stage designs, and curtailed two-stage designs.

## Conclusion

This paper implements three methods for comparing two binomial populations. Exact binomial
distribution method just directly compare two binomial populations. In contrast to the  rst
method, Simon's two-stage designs provides a more accurate outcome as well as saves the sample
size. In future study, Chi and Chen's Curtailed two-stage designs are the improvement of Simon's
designs. This paper proves that no matter in testing one binomial population or comparing
two binomial populations, Curtailed methods have a smaller expected number of patients than
Simon's methods under the same condition. The sample sizes are saved as well. In short, when
drug safety are not taken into consideration, applying Curtailed two-stage methods to compare
two drugs e eciently are highly recommended.
