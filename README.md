# Two-stage-Designs-for-Selecting-the-Best-Binomial-Populations
The research is to study two-stage designs in phase II clinical trials to select a better treatment among two experimental treatments in medical  eld. Usually people use Approximate Normal Distribution to test which one is better. However, Normal Distribution is time-consumed and can be only applied when sample size is large. If FDA want to test two drugs, this method is not e ecient. Therefore, this paper proposes methods to shorten the test process as well as the sample sizes by using Exact Binomial Distribution, Simon's two-stage designs, and curtailed two-stage designs.
